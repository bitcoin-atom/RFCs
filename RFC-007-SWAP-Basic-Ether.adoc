== Description

This RFC defines how to execute a link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc[RFC003] SWAP where one of the ledgers is Ethereum and the associated asset is the native Ether asset.

For definitions of the Ethereum ledger and Ether asset see link:RFC-006-Ethereum.md[RFC006].

To fulfil the requirements of link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc[RFC003] this RFC defines:

- The link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc#identity[identity] to be used when negotiating a SWAP on the Ethereum ledger.
- How to construct a Hash Time Lock Contract (HTLC) to lock the Ether asset on the Ethereum blockchain.
- How to deploy, redeem and refund the HTLC during the execution phase of link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc[RFC003].

== The Ethereum Identity

link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc[RFC003] requires ledgers have an *identity* type specified to negotiate a SWAP.

The identity to be used on Ethereum is the Ethereum *address* as defined in equation 284 of the https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf[Ethereum Yellowpaper]: the right most 160-bits (20 bytes) of the Keccak-256 hash of the corresponding ECDSA public key.

An ethereum address MUST be encoded as this 20 byte hex string prefixed by `0x` (as is standard in the Ethereum ecosystem).
Furthermore, implementations MUST also accept https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md[EIP50] mixed case addresses and MAY verify the checksum.

This RFC extends the link:registry.md[registry] with the following entry in the identity table:

|===
|Ledger | Identity Name |Description

| Ethereum
| `address`
| An Ethereum Address
|===


Note that since *contract* addresses and *user* addresses are indistinguishable, a contract address could be used as an identity.
RFCs that use the Ethereum identity defined here should explain the impact (if any) this has on the protocol.

== Hash Time Lock Contract

=== Hash Functions

This RFC specifies SHA-256 as the only value the `hash_function` parameter to `comit-rfc-003` may take if Ethereum is used as a ledger.
This may be expanded in subsequent RFCs.

=== Parameters

The parameters for the Ether HTLC follow link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc#hash-time-lock-contract-htlc[RFC003] and are described concretely in the following table:

|===
|Variable | Description

| asset
| The quantity of wei

| secret_hash
| The hash of the `secret` (32 bytes for SHA-256)

| redeem_identity
| The `address` of the redeeming party

| refund_identity
| The `address` of the refunding party

| expiry
| The absolute UNIX timestamp in seconds after which the HTLC can be refunded
|===


=== Contract

This RFC defines a single disposable contract as the HTLC.
It uses the `selfdestruct` EVM opcode to release the funds to the intended party.

This approach was chosen over a stateful contract written in solidity so that the contract can be precisely defined, verified and updated.

The `redeem_identity` and `refund_identity` are hard coded into the contract.
If called with the correct `secret` as the calldata it will transfer all the Ether to the `redeem_identity` using `selfdestruct`.
If called without any calldata after the `expiry` it will transfer all the Ether to the `refund_identity` using `selfdestruct`.

The contract never checks the caller so the redeem and refund transactions can be sent by anyone.
The funds will only ever be transferred to the `redeem_identity` or the `refund_identity`.
No special considerations need to be made when either identity is a contract address as they simply receive funds.

The contract is compiled from the following EVM assembly:

[source,asm]
----
{
    // Load received secret size
    calldatasize

    // Check if secret is zero length
    iszero

    // If secret is zero length, jump to branch that checks if expiry time has been reached
    check_expiry
    jumpi

    // Load expected secret size
    32

    // Load received secret size
    calldatasize

    // Compare secret size
    eq
    iszero

    // If passed secret is wrong size, jump to exit contract
    invalid_secret
    jumpi

    // Load secret into memory
    calldatacopy(0, 0, 32)

    // Hash secret with SHA-256 (pre-compiled contract 0x02)
    call(72, 0x02, 0, 0, 32, 33, 32)

    // Placeholder for correct secret hash
    <secret_hash>

    // Load hashed secret from memory
    mload(33)

    // Compare hashed secret with existing one
    eq

    // Combine `eq` result with `call` result
    and

    // Jump to redeem if hashes match
    redeem
    jumpi

    // Continue to invalid secret if no match
invalid_secret:
    // return "invalidSecret" = 0x696e76616c69645365637265740000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    mstore(0, "invalidSecret")
    revert(0, 32)

check_expiry:
    // Timestamp of the current block in seconds since the epoch
    timestamp

    // Placeholder for refund timestamp
    <expiry>

    // Compare refund timestamp with current timestamp
    lt

    // Jump to refund if time is expired
    refund
    jumpi

    mstore(0, "tooEarly")
    revert(0, 32)


redeem:
    // log ascii to hex of "redeemed"
    // 0x72656465656d6564000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    log1(0, 32, "redeemed")
    selfdestruct(<redeem_identity>)

refund:

To compile the contract code replace the placeholder values with the HTLC parameters at the following offsets:

|===
|Name | Byte Range | Length (bytes)

| `secret_hash`
| 53..85
| 32

| `refund_timestamp`
| 139..143
| 4

| `redeem_address`
| 229..249
| 20

| `refund_address`
| 290..310
| 20
|===


The contract emits two logs:

|===
| Topic | keccack256(Topic)| Data  | Emitted When

| ascii to hex of `redeemed`
| 0x72656465656d6564000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

| -
| The contract is refunded

|===

The contract returns two different error values the failure case:

|===
| Description | bytes  | Emitted When

| ascii to hex of `invalidSecret`
| 0x696e76616c69645365637265740000000000000000000000000000000000000000

| Attempt to refund too early

|===


Implementations SHOULD use the following gas limits on the transactions related to the contract:

|===
| Transaction | recommended gas limit

| Deployment

== Execution Phase

The following section describes how both parties should interact with the Ethereum blockchain during the link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc#execution-phase[RFC003 execution phase].

=== Deployment

At the start of the deployment stage, both parties compile the contract code as described in the previous section.
We will call this value `contract_code`.

To deploy the Ether HTLC, the *funder* must deploy the `contract_code`.
They SHOULD do this by sending a contract deployment transaction to the relevant Ethereum blockchain with:

- `contract_code` as the `data` of the transaction
- The quantity of wei specified in the Ether Asset header as the `value` of the transaction

The funder SHOULD NOT do this through another contract, i.e. by executing the `CREATE` opcode.

To be notified of the deployment event, both parties MAY watch the blockchain for a transaction with the `contract_code` as the data.
Upon observing the deployment transaction, both parties SHOULD record the address the contract was deployed to (referred to as `contract_address` from now on).

=== Redeem

Before redeeming, the redeemer SHOULD wait until the deployment transaction has enough confirmation such that they consider it permanent.

To redeem the HTLC, the redeemer SHOULD send a transaction to the `contract_address` with the `data` of the transaction set to the `secret`.

To be notified of the redeem event, both parties SHOULD watch the blockchain for `contract_address` emitting the `Redeemed()` log.
If Ethereum is the `beta_ledger` (see link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc#execution-phase[RFC003]), then the funder MUST watch for such a log, extract the `secret` from the transaction receipt and continue the protocol.
In this case, Bob MUST NOT watch for a transaction sent to `contract_address` with the `secret` as `data`.
This would be insufficient, because he would miss learning the `secret` if the contract is redeemed by a call from another contract (rather than from a transaction).

=== Refund

To refund the HTLC, the funder MUST send a transaction to `contract_address` with empty data in a block with timestamp greater than `expiry`.

To be notified of the refund event, both parties SHOULD watch the blockchain for  `contract_address` emitting the `Refunded()` log.

=== Failure

A transaction to the HTLC will fail in two cases:

. *If redeem was attempted with an invalid secret*: the contract will return `invalidSecret` int bytes (`0x696e76616c69645365637265740000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)
. *If refund was attempted too early*: the contract will return `tooEarly` int bytes (`0x746f6f4561726c79000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)

== Registry extension

This RFC extends the link:registry.md#identities[registry] with an identity definition for the Ethereum ledger:

|===
| Ledger   | Identity Name | Encoding | Description

| Ethereum
| `address`
| `0x` prefixed address
| An Ethereum Address
|===

= Examples/Test vectors

== RFC003 SWAP REQUEST

The following shows an link:RFC-003-SWAP-Basic.adoc[RFC003] SWAP REQUEST where the `alpha_ledger` is Ethereum, the `alpha_asset` is 1 Ether (with `...` being used where the value is only relevant for the `beta_ledger`).
