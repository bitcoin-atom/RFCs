# COMIT RFCs

1. [BAM!-Protocol (Bidirectional Application Messaging)](./RFC-001-BAM.md)
2. [SWAP Message Types](./RFC-002-SWAP.md)
3. [Basic HTLC Atomic Swap](./RFC-003-SWAP-basic.md)

# Registry

The [registry](./registry.md) is our lean attempt to do something like [IANA](https://www.iana.org/) for the COMIT protocol.
For the time being, it is just a text file involved in the RFC process.
